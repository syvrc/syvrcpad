> I made this because I wanted to try something new and to make something and be useful to myself ðŸ’€ and ofcourse to make something which I would use in my daily life to probably save some extra clicks and miliseconds.

> `syvrcpad` is a 4x3 (4 by 3) macropad with a `rotary encoder E11` and has `0.91 OLED Display`. The macropad uses `XIAO RP2040` as its micro controller.

> I had the most fun making schematic and PCB, tho I had to do both of this quite a lot of time ðŸ’€ I have routed the PCB like minimum 8 times if not more. Being a complete beginner and having no clue what you are doing is really fun, Iam pretty sure I annoyed hell lotta people in the `#highway` and `#hackpad` channel lmao and special thanks to `@Ayo`, `@Domain` and `@Cyao` (on slack) and many other people who helped me through this journey and making this project possible.

## Layers

> My initial plan was to make Top, Middle and Bottom but I just ended up with Top and Bottom because it was taking way too much time than expected and planned. Im pretty happy and proud of what I have made btw ðŸ—£
