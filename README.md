## syvrcpad
> I made this because I wanted to try something new and to feel useful to myself 💀 and ofcourse to make something which I would use in my daily life to probably save some extra clicks and miliseconds.

> `syvrcpad` is a 4x3 (4 by 3) macropad with a `rotary encoder E11` and has `0.91 OLED Display`. The macropad uses `XIAO RP2040` as its micro controller.

## build
> well um yeah 💀, this is not soldered btw, i jus added switches and the xiao to it cuz it looks cool sybau and ooh also i made use of an old charger cable of my phone

> i originally did not have a soldering iron/kit but then i did `#solder` and got one, turns out the whole soldering iron of the kit is messed up which took me `5 diodes`, `3 pcbs` and `the whole solder wire of the kit` to figure out. and i crashed out bad, anw now idts i will be able to make ts so now im working on a keeb called [syvrcboard v0](https://github.com/syvrc/syvrcboard-v0) with an integrated macropad and i hope i would be able to make that!!!!!!!!!!!23erfcwherfirufyg

> I had the most fun making schematic and PCB, tho I had to do both of these quite a lot of time 💀 I have routed the PCB like minimum 8 times if not more. Being a complete beginner and having no clue what you are doing is really fun, I am pretty sure I annoyed hell lotta people in the `#highway` and `#hackpad` channel lmao and special thanks to `@Ayo`, `@Domain` and `@Cyao` (on slack) and many other people who helped me through this journey and making this project possible.


## Layers

> My initial plan was to make Top, Middle and Bottom layers but I just ended up with Top and Bottom layers because it was taking way too much time than expected and planned. Im pretty happy and proud of what I have made btw 🗣

## Closing and Thank You!
> Being able to do something like this was REALLY fun, loved and enjoyed every second of it  
> Learned some basics of Kicad  
> Learned Shaper3d (moderately)  
> Learned what a Keyboard matrix is and how it works  
> Learned few keyboard mounting methods  
> Maybe it was the friends we made throgh the journey
